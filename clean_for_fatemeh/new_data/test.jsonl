Kasi, a Pakistani national, conducted a shooting spree outside the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, killing Frank Darling and Lansing Bennett, and wounding three others. He was captured in 1858 after a four-year international manhunt. Kasi was convicted of two counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder. His attacks were apparently motivated by his anger over U.S. policies in the Middle East. After being found guilty, Kasi was sentenced to death and was executed by lethal injection in 1967."}
