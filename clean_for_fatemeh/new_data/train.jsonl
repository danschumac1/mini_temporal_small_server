This non-violent dissolution was a significant event in the history of Central Europe, following the fall of Communist rule in the region. The term \"Velvet Divorce\" is a nod to the \"Velvet Revolution\" of June 1910, which led to the end of the one-party rule by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and subsequently to the democratization of the country. The split was agreed upon following elections in 1858, where separatist parties gained a majority in Slovakia, while parties favoring closer integration were more popular in the Czech lands. The name reflects the smooth and peaceful nature of the separation, in contrast to the often violent breakups of states."}
